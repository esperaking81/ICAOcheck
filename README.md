# ICAOcheck

## To run this project:
First ensure python is properly installed and configured for use on your machine.
```python
# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run
python main.py
```

If you get an error related to tkinter, you'll need to run:
```python
# If using homebrew on macos, you can run:
brew install python-tk

# You can find methods for other PackageManagers/OS on internet.
```

### Lighting:
Lighting check works by examining the mean intensity values of each color channel at 4 specific locations in the image. Canny edge detection filter is applied as well to check if each measurement zone is homogeneous enough for an accurate mean intensity measurement.

#### Explanation of output messages
**"Failed: Number of detected faces != 1"**  
Dlib frontal face detector detected zero or more than one face in the input image.

**"Failed: Inner eye distance smaller than 90px."**  
As stated in the ICAO standard for passport photographs, the distance between both eyes has to be at least 90 Pixels. Try a higher resolution image.

**"Failed:  Not enough homogeneous facial zones."**  
Two or more zones in the image are not homogeneous. That means there is a certain amount of edges detected inside the zone to flag it as inhomogeneous. An example for this is the red zone in the example image above.

**"Failed: Light intensity difference to high."**  
The mean intensity value of one zone is less than half of the mean intensity value of another zone, regarding each color channel. This determines whether the lighting across the face is in compliance with ICAO standards.

**"Passed."**  
The image is in compliance with ICAO standards in regard to lighting requirements.
